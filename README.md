# Pet Adoption

#### Every animal deserves an opportunity of having a responsible owner, not an owner who wants a pet during dark times in life and to be neglected or thrown away.
### Solution: 
A website designed to help foster animals not only during the quarantine but also after the event due to a possible influx of foster animals returning back to shelters after owners realize they cannot take care of their pets once their lives return to normal. 
### Concept:
When you input a zip code and select your preference of cat or dog, you will be given 20 cats or dogs that are up for adoption based on a 100 mile radius. 

### App Development
* We used petfinder API to track animals based on location and type of animal. For our design framework we used Bulma to style our code.
* We worked in pairs and communicated through slack. We had a video call when we needed to address merge conflicts and go through them together. 
*Tasks were assigned through Trello and by the project manager/scrum manager. At the start of each session, we review our progress then assign new tasks for the day.

### Challenges:
* Coordinating Github with multiple branches. 
* Getting keys to work for the pet finder. 
* Pictures arenâ€™t always rendering correctly for each animal.
* Code usually breaks when pictures are invalid.

### Outcome: 
* We got our API key to work with authorization(thanks Manny). 
* Rendered pictures without breaking code(thanks musa for 5 min quick session).Styling our webpage to look cute.
